Some good tools for linting our Java application would be, for example, Checkstyle. It is one of the most popular linters available and  can be used with a great variety of development IDEs. Other options to consider for linting could be Uncrustify and PMD. For building we could use for example Maven or Gradle, that are best building tools for Java applications. For testing there are many good frameworks and libraries such as JUnit or Selenium, and we could use those two together to make automated testing work in our project.

For setting up the CI, some good alternatives for Jenkins or GitHub Actions are TeamCity and Buddy Works, both of them supporting Java and can be used in self-hosted or cloud environment.  Using this setup would be better in a cloud-based environment because our application will not be so big scale, as there are only six developers. Using cloud based environment is mostly cheaper and saves us from any extra hassle that would occur if we used self-hosted environment. However, self-hosted environment would give so much freedom for us to configure everything and cloud-based environment bills us by how long it takes to build our application, so thorough evaluation is required until we can decide what kind of environment we would set up.
